On February 25, 2022 my mother lost her short battle with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. Since the time of her death I've picked back up my love for motorcycling and discovered that I enjoy long solo motorcycle camping trips. This trip is to continue stepping out of my confort zone and push my physical and mental abilities. And what a better cause than to raise money for the American Lung Association as I continue my journey.

## Overview

Stage 1 - On Monday, July 24, 2023 I'll begin this journey from Saint Augustine, FL as I ride south to Key West for the official starting location. From there I'll ride north through the midwest states, through Canada heading towards Fairbanks, AK, from there I'll pickup the Dalton Highway, a desolate road (the term “road” used loosely!) that runs 414 miles from just north of Fairbanks to just south of the Arctic Ocean in the oil fields of Deadhorse (Pruhdoe Bay), AK. It's none as one of the worlds most deadliest roads.

Stage 2 - After resting for a few hours I'll back down the Dalton Highway through Fairbanks then head towards Whitehorse, Yukon, CA. I'll head north towards the Dempster Highway to my stage 2 destination of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, CA where I'll ride out to the Arctic Ocean and take a quick swim.

Stage 3 - After spending the night in Tuktoyaktuk I'll begin the journey home heading south to visit Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Arches, Bryce Canyon, and Zion National Parks in Utah, Whitesands National Park in New Mexico, Big Bend National Park in Texas, and then head East towards Saint Augustine, FL for home.

The total trip shuold take around 5 weeks and cover over 15,000 miles.
